## Computational Neuroscience

I have been contributing to the [neural network simulator NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org) since 2012, see [NEST on github](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator).

## Machine Learning

I have a collection of machine learning models that I implemented for testing and educational purposes. Currently, it comprises code for an autoencoder and a variational autoencoder. The code is hosted in my public github repository: [ml_code](https://github.com/mschmidt87/ml_code).

## Python software

I have co-authored two small Python libaries:
- `python-dicthash` [(github repository)](https://github.com/INM-6/python-dicthash): A python module that generates md5 hashes from arbitrarily nested dictionaries.

- `h5py_wrapper` [(github repository)](https://github.com/INM-6/h5py_wrapper): A python module that stores nested dictionaries in hdf5 files, wraps around the h5py library. See also [documentation website](http://h5py-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [h5py_wrapper on pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/h5py-wrapper/1.0.1).
