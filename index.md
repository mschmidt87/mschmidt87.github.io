Welcome to my private github pages. The pages present a collection of my past works in research and software development.

I am a researcher in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning with a Master's degree in Physics and a PhD in natural sciences. My interests include various topics in Computational Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I have a strong background in programming and experience in parallel computing and software development. Since March 2017, I am a member of the [Laboratory for Neural Circuit Theory](http://nct.brain.riken.jp/index.en.php) at RIKEN Brain Science Institut in Japan.
