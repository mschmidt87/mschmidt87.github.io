Welcome to my private github pages. The pages present a collection of my past works in research and software development.

I am a researcher in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning with a Master's degree in Physics and a PhD in natural sciences. My interests include various topics in Computational Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I have a strong background in programming and experience in parallel computing and software development. I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [KPMG Ignition Tokyo](https://home.kpmg/jp/en/home/about/kit.html).
