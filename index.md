Welcome to my private github pages. The pages present a collection of my past works in research and software development and some texts with a focus on sustainability and environmental protection.

I am a Data Scientist with a background in Computational Neuroscience and Physics. I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [KPMG Ignition Tokyo](https://home.kpmg/jp/en/home/about/kit.html). Please note that this website and its contents reflect my personal views and not the views of my employer.

I used to be a researcher in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning. I am holding a Master's degree in Physics (from Heidelberg University) and a PhD in natural sciences. In my PhD, I did research in Computational Neuroscience and developed a bottom-up network model of a macaque monkey's visual cortex. After my PhD, I moved into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

My current interests span topics from Artificial Intelligence and Statistics to Sustainability and Environmental Protection. In AI and Statistics, I am interested in Bayesian Data Analysis and Causal Inference. I believe that Causal Inference and its combination with Machine Learning and AI will be the "next big thing" both in (business-oriented, practical) Data Science as well as in (academic) research of Artificial Intelligence.

An even bigger and more important topic is the ecological and climate crisis that humanity is facing. I am trying to make my small contribution to a solution by being a volunteer at GermanZero (https://www.germanzero.de/), an initiative that wrote a legislative to enable Germany to fulfil its contribution to the 1.5Â°C target of the Paris agreement. Furthermore, I am trying to learn as much as possible about the topics relevant to solving the crisis, the science, the technology and the politics around it.
